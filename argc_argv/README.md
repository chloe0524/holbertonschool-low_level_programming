## Task 0: It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to

Mandatory

Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again. You should not remove the path before the name of the program.

## Task 1: Silence is argument carried out by other means

Mandatory

Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

Your program should print a number, followed by a new line.

## Task 2: The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter

Mandatory

Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.

All arguments should be printed, including the first one. Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line.

## Task 3: Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument

Mandatory

Write a program that multiplies two numbers.

Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line. You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer. If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1.

## Task 4: To infinity and beyond

Mandatory

Write a program that adds positive numbers.

Print the result, followed by a new line. If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line. If one of the numbers contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1. You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int.
