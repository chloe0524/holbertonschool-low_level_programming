Prototype: int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);
If n == 0, return 0

1. To be is to be the value of a variable
mandatory
Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.

You are allowed to use printf
If separator is NULL, don’t print it
Print a new line at the end of your function

2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable
mandatory
Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);
where separator is the string to be printed between the strings
and n is the number of strings passed to the function
You are allowed to use printf
If separator is NULL, don’t print it
If one of the string is NULL, print (nil) instead
Print a new line at the end of your function

Prototype: void print_all(const char * const format, ...);
where format is a list of types of arguments passed to the function
c: char
i: integer
f: float
s: char * (if the string is NULL, print (nil) instead
any other char should be ignored
