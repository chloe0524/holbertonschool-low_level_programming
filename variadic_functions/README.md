# Tasks

### <span style="color: green;">0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant</span>

**mandatory**

Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

Prototype: `int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);`

If n == 0, return 0

### <span style="color: green;">1. To be is to be the value of a variable</span>

**mandatory**

Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.

Prototype: `void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);`

where `separator` is the string to be printed between numbers and `n` is the number of integers passed to the function. You are allowed to use `printf`. If `separator` is NULL, don’t print it. Print a new line at the end of your function.

@@#2.One woman's constant is another woman's variable</span>

**mandatory**

Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.

Prototype: `void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);`

where `separator` is the string to be printed between the strings and `n` is the number of strings passed to the function. You are allowed to use `printf`. If `separator` is NULL, don’t print it. If one of the strings is NULL, print `(nil)` instead. Print a new line at the end of your function.
